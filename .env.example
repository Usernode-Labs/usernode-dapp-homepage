# Copy this file to .env and adjust values as needed.
# .env is gitignored and will not be committed.

# Server port (default: 8000)
#PORT=8000

# Override the path to the dapps JSON config file.
# When --local-dev is passed, the server automatically uses dapps.local.json
# (if it exists) without needing this variable. Use DAPPS_JSON_PATH only if
# you want to point at a completely custom file.
